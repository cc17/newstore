  "readme": "# grunt-htmlclean\n\nSimple and lightweight cleaner for HTML that just removes unneeded whitespaces, line-breaks, comments, etc.  \nThis plugin is wrapper of [htmlclean](https://github.com/anseki/htmlclean).\n\n[HtmlCompressor](http://code.google.com/p/htmlcompressor/), [HTMLMinifier](https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier) and others are better choice if you want to control details of editing.  \nThose configuring are a little pain in the neck for me. And the results was not what I need. So, I wrote htmlclean. This removes unneeded whitespaces, line-breaks, comments, etc. That's all.\n\n## Removing\nhtmlclean removes the following texts.\n\n+ The leading whitespaces, tabs and line-breaks, and the trailing whitespaces, tabs and line-breaks.\n+ The unneeded whitespaces, tabs and line-breaks between HTML tags.\n+ The more than two whitespaces, tabs and line-breaks (suppressed to one space).\n+ HTML comments.\n\nThe more than two whitespaces in a line that includes HTML tags are suppressed.\n\n**Example:**\n\nBefore\n\n```html\n<p>The <strong> clean <span> <em> HTML is here. </em> </span> </strong> </p>\n```\n\nAfter\n\n```html\n<p>The <strong>clean <span><em>HTML is here.</em></span></strong></p>\n```\n\n## Protecting\nThe following texts are protected (excluded from removing).\n\n+ The texts in `textarea`, `script` and `style` elements, and text nodes in `pre` elements.\n+ The quoted texts in tag attribute.\n+ Apache SSI tags.\n+ IE conditional comments. e.g. `<!--[if lt IE 7]>`\n+ The texts between `<!--[htmlclean-protect]-->` and `<!--[/htmlclean-protect]-->`.\n+ The texts that is matched by `protect` option (see \"Options\").\n\n## More Informations\nSee [htmlclean](https://github.com/anseki/htmlclean).\n\n## Getting Started\nThis plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.1`\n\nIf you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:\n\n```shell\nnpm install grunt-htmlclean --save-dev\n```\n\nOnce the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-htmlclean');\n```\n\n## The \"htmlclean\" task\n\n### Overview\nIn your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `htmlclean` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  htmlclean: {\n    options: {\n      protect: /<\\!--%fooTemplate\\b.*?%-->/g,\n      edit: function(html) { return html.replace(/\\begg(s?)\\b/ig, 'omelet$1'); }\n    },\n    deploy: {\n      expand: true,\n      cwd: 'develop/',\n      src: '**/*.html',\n      dest: 'public_html/'\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\nSee [htmlclean](https://github.com/anseki/htmlclean) for options and more information.\n\n## Working with grunt-task-helper\nFor example, you want to clean only changed HTML files. Then [grunt-task-helper](https://github.com/anseki/grunt-task-helper) helps it. In this case, using `handlerByContent` Function instead of this plugin is better. Because grunt parses `files` components in every tasks(targets). `handlerByContent` can be included to one task with other handlers (e.g. select changed HTML files).  \nSee [grunt-task-helper](https://github.com/anseki/grunt-task-helper).\n\nExample:\n\n`Gruntfile.js`\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  taskHelper: {\n    deploy: {\n      options: {\n        // Select files which are newer than `dest`.\n        handlerByFile: 'newFile',\n        // Clean the selected files.\n        handlerByContent: require('grunt-htmlclean/node_modules/htmlclean')\n        //handlerByContent: require('htmlclean') // If htmlclean is already installed. (Not grunt-htmlclean)\n      },\n      expand: true,\n      cwd: 'develop/',\n      src: '**/*.html',\n      dest: 'public_html/'\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Release History\n * 2013-11-06\t\t\tv0.1.3\t\t\tUpdate package.json for htmlclean v2.0.0. (This script is not changed.)\n * 2013-08-27\t\t\tv0.1.0\t\t\tInitial release.\n",
